# Andy, üëã from the exotic island of Madagascar!

*I'm a T-shaped engineer crafting great code with good balance from this savory remote location.* üå¥ üåû

‚öõÔ∏è My core skills orbit around **Full-Stack SaaS platforms engineering**.

üåç I work fully remote from GMT+3 collaborating with great teammates around the globe stretching from US-PST to far-east Asia.

üöÄ I took key roles as **Senior/Lead/CTO** within US/EU/MENA based companies for the past 8+ years. My latest **Founding-Engineer** endeavors can be seen at <a href="https://apidojo.com" target="_blank">Apidojo</a> and <a href="https://conflexity.com" target="_blank">Conflexity</a>
