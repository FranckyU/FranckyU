# Andy, ðŸ‘‹ from the exotic island of Madagascar!

*I'm a T-shaped engineer crafting great code with good balance from this savory remote location.*

My core skills orbit around Full-Stack SaaS platforms engineering.

I took key roles as **Senior/Lead/CTO** for the past 8+ years. I work fully remote from GMT+3 collaborating with great teammates around the :earth_americas: stretching from US-PST to far-east Asia.
